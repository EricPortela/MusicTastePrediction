# MusicTastePrediction


Music taste prediction using data from the Spotify API.

music-taste-prediction.ipynb is the main Notebook - Check it out :)

Process can be divided into three different steps

1. Eploratory Data Analysis & Data preprocessing
2. Split data into X (features) and y (label/target, binary, meaning to recommend or not)
3. Train 4 different models, with different ranges of interpretabillity and flexibillity

Four different models trained:

- Knearest Neighbour (KNN) ==> High Flexibillity, low interpretabllity
- Multiple Logistic Regression ==> Low Flexibillity, high interpretabllity
- Random Forest Classifier ==> Low Flexibillity, high interpretabllity
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC) ==> High Flexibillity, low interpretabllity
